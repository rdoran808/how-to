  <h1> How To Fancy</h1>

  <h2> Not Your Average Cupcake Recipe </h2>

  <p> So you're having a gathering, a party of sorts, and the generic store bought chocolate and vanilla cupcakes with overly sweet frosting just won't cut it. You want your guests to be blown away by your fanciness and origianlity. Well if that's the case, I've got the perfect cupcake recipe for you! The <em>Lemon Coconut Cupcake with Rasberry Filling</em> is perhaps the fanciest, and most delicious cupcake I have ever tasted. </p> 
 
  <h3> Here's what you'll need: </h3>
 
  <ul>
    <li>Lemon cake mix</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
